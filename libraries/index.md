# Client Libraries

Client libraries are the tools that let you develop your own applications
to work with {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} databases.
{: shortdesc}

The following client libraries are formally [supported](/docs/services/Cloudant/libraries/supported.html) by {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

-	[Mobile](/docs/services/Cloudant/libraries/supported.html#mobile)
-	[Java](/docs/services/Cloudant/libraries/supported.html#java)
-	[Node.js](/docs/services/Cloudant/libraries/supported.html#node-js)
-	[Python](/docs/services/Cloudant/libraries/supported.html#python)
-	[Swift](/docs/services/Cloudant/libraries/supported.html#swift)

A supported library is one where you can contact {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} if you encounter a specific,
reproducible problem in the latest version of the library.

Other client libraries have been created by
[third parties](/docs/services/Cloudant/libraries/thirdparty.html#third-party-client-libraries) or are no longer officially supported.

Third-party client libraries are not maintained or supported by {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}. If you encounter a specific, reproducible problem with a third-party library, contact the library maintainer for assistance.
