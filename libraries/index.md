# Client Libraries

Client libraries are the tools that let you develop your own applications
to work with {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} databases.
{:shortdesc}

The following client libraries are formally [supported](supported.html) by {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

-	[Mobile](supported.html#mobile)
-	[Java](supported.html#java)
-	[Node.js](supported.html#node-js)
-	[Python](supported.html#python)
-	[Swift](supported.html#swift)

A supported library is one where you can contact {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} if you encounter a specific,
reproducible problem in the latest version of the library.

Other client libraries have been created by
[third parties](thirdparty.html#third-party-client-libraries) or are no longer officially supported.

>   **Note**: Third-party client libraries are not maintained or supported by {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.
    If you encounter a specific,
    reproducible problem with a third-party library,
    you should contact the library maintainer for assistance.
