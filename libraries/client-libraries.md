# Client libraries
{: #client-libraries}

Client libraries are the tools that you use to develop your own applications
to work with {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} databases.
{: shortdesc}

The following client libraries are formally [supported](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-supported-client-libraries#supported-client-libraries) by {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

-	[Mobile](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-supported-client-libraries#mobile-supported)
-	[Java&trade;](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-supported-client-libraries#java-supported)
-	[Node.js](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-supported-client-libraries#node-js-supported)
-	[Swift](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-supported-client-libraries#swift)
-	[Python](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-supported-client-libraries#python-supported)

A supported library is one where you can contact {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} if you come across a specific,
reproducible problem in the current version of the library.

Other client libraries that were created by
[third parties](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-third-party-client-libraries#third-party-client-libraries) or are no longer officially supported.

Third-party client libraries are not maintained or supported by {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}. If you come across a specific, reproducible problem with a third-party library, contact the library maintainer for assistance.
