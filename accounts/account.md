# Working with your {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} account
{: #work-with-your-account}

Your account is your entry point for the {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} API.
You access your account by using the address prefix
`https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com`.
Your {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Dashboard is always
`https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/dashboard.html`.
{: shortdesc}

If you don't yet have an account, [sign up](https://cloudant.com/sign-up/){: new_window}{: external}.

To see whether your {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} account is accessible,
make a `GET` against `https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com`.
If you misspell your account name,
you might get a [503 "service unavailable" error](/apidocs/cloudant#list-of-http-codes){: new_window}{: external}.

You can provide your credentials (authenticate) in the following ways for {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}}:

-	[Identity and Access Management (IAM)](#authentication-iam)
-	[Basic authentication](#basic-authentication)
-	[Cookie authentication](#cookie-authentication)

## IAM authentication
{: #authentication-iam}

You can perform the following tasks with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Identity and Access Management (IAM): 

- Centrally manage access management across {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
- Allow a user or service to access many different resources by using the same set of credentials (for  example, same username and password or IAM API key).
- IAM API keys can be granted access to account management functions, like creating new databases.

For more information, see [Managing access](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-managing-access-for-cloudant) or an overview of [IAM](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview){: new_window}{: external}.

## Authentication
{: #authentication}

Authentication means proving who you are.
You prove your identity by supplying your user credentials for verification.

Basic authentication is similar to showing an ID at a door to be checked every time that you want to enter.
Cookie authentication is similar to having a key to the door so that you can let yourself in whenever you want.
Within {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}},
the key is a cookie that is named `AuthSession`.

When you create or use performance-critical {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} applications, cookie authentication has more benefits when compared with Basic authentication. We recommend that you use cookie authentication whenever possible.
{: note}

### Basic authentication
{: #basic-authentication}

To use Basic authentication,
pass your credentials as part of every request.
You pass your credentials by adding an `Authorization` header to the request.

The header includes the authentication scheme (`Basic`),
followed by the [BASE64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64){: new_window}{: external} encoding of a string created by concatenating:

-	Your username
-	The `:` character
-	Your password

In practice,
many application libraries that are used for creating HTTP requests can do this encoding for you.

For more information on basic authentication, see [Security scheme](/apidocs/cloudant#security-scheme){: new_window}{: external}.

### Cookie authentication
{: #cookie-authentication}

Cookie authentication requires that you supply a valid username and password once,
at the start of a series of tasks (the session).
The response includes a cookie,
generated by the server,
that confirms you successfully authenticated.
After the cookie is created,
you send the cookie with all requests that require authentication.

The presence of a valid cookie is sufficient to ensure that your call request is processed
rather than rejected immediately as unauthenticated.
You can use the cookie until it expires.

Using the `DELETE` method logs out the user because the cookie is considered expired by the server.

Method | Path | Description | Headers | Form Parameters
-------|------|-------------|---------|----------------------
`POST` | `/_session` | Do cookie-based user login. | `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | `name`, `password`
`GET` | `/_session` | Returns cookie-based login user information. | AuthSession cookie returned by POST request. | 
`DELETE` | `/_session` | Log out cookie-based user. | AuthSession cookie returned by POST request. | 
{: caption="Table 1. Cookie authentication and methods" caption-side="top"}

For more information on basic authentication, see [Security scheme](/apidocs/cloudant#security-scheme){: new_window}{: external}.

## Authorization
{: #authorization}

After authenticating, the next test is to decide whether you're allowed to do certain tasks.
This decision is called authorization.

When you authenticate with the {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} system,
it "knows" who you are.
The next question is, what tasks are you allowed to do?

You might create a complete list of all the possible tasks that you can do,
for each aspect of an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} system, such as a database or a document.
Although simple,
this approach would require many lengthy lists.
Keeping those lists accurate and complete is impractical.

A better approach uses the idea of "roles".
The various tasks can be grouped into collections that are typical of some generic roles.
For example,
the task of creating or deleting a database is characteristic of someone with an administrative role.
Similarly,
the task or creating or updating a document is characteristic of someone with a "writing" role.

Rather than explicitly listing every task you can do,
you're given one or more roles.
If you have a role,
then you can do all the tasks that are associated with that role.

## Roles
{: #roles}

This section pertains to Legacy credentials only. For more information about using roles with IAM credentials, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} roles](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-managing-access-for-cloudant#ibm-cloudant-roles-ai){: new_window}{: external}.
{: tip}

{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} has a number of roles available.
The roles can be assigned to user accounts or [API keys](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-account#creating-api-keys).

The three core roles are defined in the following table:

Role      | Description
----------|------------
`_admin`  | Change security settings, including adding roles.
`_reader` | Read documents from the database.
`_writer` | Create, update, and delete documents (except design documents) in the database.
{: caption="Table 1. Core roles" caption-side="top"}

The `_reader` and `_writer` roles are exclusive. If a user has the `_writer` role, they can't read documents that they create unless they *also* have the `_reader` role.
{: tip}

You might want to assign more than one role.
For example,
a user might need to read from or write to documents within a database,
but wouldn't need full administrative control over the database.
To fulfill this requirement,
the user's account is granted the `_reader` and `_writer` roles,
but not the `_admin` role.

A number of "focused" roles are also available.
These provide permissions for specific API endpoints.
The focused role permissions are similar to the core role permissions,
but apply *only* to the specific API endpoint.

The focused roles are defined in the following table:

Role | Description | API Endpoints
-----|-------------|---------------
`_design`     | Allows create, read, modify, or delete access to design documents. | [`_design`](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-design-documents#design-documents), [`_find`](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query#working-with-indexes), [`_index`](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query#working-with-indexes)
`_replicator` | Allows read access to replicate data from a database, and write access to create checkpoints. | [`_local`](/apidocs/cloudant?code=node#postreplicate){: new_window}{: external}, [`_replicate`](/apidocs/cloudant#postreplicate){: new_window}{: external}, [`_replicator`](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-replication-api#the-_replicator-database)
`_security`   | Allows read and write access to the `/$DATABASE/_security` endpoint. | [`_security`](/apidocs/cloudant#getsecurity){: new_window}{: external}
{: caption="Table 2. Focused roles" caption-side="top"}

The nature of the access that is granted depends on the specific API endpoint.
For example,
the `_design` role provides access that allows a user or [API key](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-account#creating-api-keys) to create,
read,
modify,
or delete design documents. If you grant access this way, the advantage is that you're not required to assign the more widely applicable `_reader` or `_writer` roles.
This distinction is useful because otherwise the authorized account could read from or write to documents within the database,
other than the design documents.

The credentials that you use to log in to the dashboard automatically have the `_admin` role for all databases you create.
Everyone and everything else,
including users that you share databases with,
and API keys you create,
must be given a role explicitly to do corresponding tasks.

The special `nobody` username applies for anyone or any application that tries to do tasks,
but that didn't authenticate with the system.
In other words,
the `nobody` username applies to all unauthenticated connection attempts.
For example,
if an application tries to read data from a database,
but didn't identify itself,
the task can continue only if the `nobody` user has the role `_reader`.

It's possible to grant more powerful roles to an *un*authenticated user than to an authenticated user.
For example,
if the `nobody` username is intentionally granted `_admin`,
`_reader`,
and `_writer` roles,
but an authenticated user account such as `alexone` is granted only the `_reader` role. In this case, it's possible that an unauthenticated user might have a more powerful role than the authenticated `alexone` user. 

It's important to understand that the `nobody` username is *not* a way of supplying a default set of permissions. Instead, the `nobody` username is used to determine permissions for *unauthenticated* users.
{: tip}

### Determining the role to assign
{: #determining-the-role-to-assign}

When you determine the role or roles to assign to a user account or API key,
it's best to assign a role with the least permissions necessary to do the tasks for that account or API key.

If the tasks are for a specific aspect,
such as working with design documents or security settings,
then assign a focused role, such as `_design` or `_security`.


## API keys
{: #api-keys}

This section pertains to Legacy credentials only. For more information about using API keys with IAM credentials, see [IAM API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manapikey){: new_window}{: external}.
{: tip}

Use API keys to enable database access for a person or application,
but without creating a new {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} account for that person or application.
An API key is a randomly generated username and password.
The key is given the wanted access permissions for a database.

When a key is generated,
and granted the required access permissions,
the API key can be used in the same way as a normal user account.

However, API keys aren't the same as normal user accounts.
An API key doesn't have access to the dashboard.

An API key is primarily used to enable applications to access a database,
with a determined level of access control.

All {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instances that are deployed 
from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Public Germany 
region are deployed in EU-managed environments. Any 
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} account or 
API key that is generated outside an EU-managed environment can't be granted 
access to an EU-managed {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instance. 
For more information about {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} 
in an EU-managed environment, see 
[Locations and tenancy](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public#locations-and-tenancy).
{: tip}

### Creating API keys
{: #creating-api-keys}

An earlier method of generating API keys by `POST`ing to the `https://cloudant.com/api/generate_api_key` endpoint is deprecated.
{: deprecated}

You can create an API key in two ways:

1.  Using the dashboard.
2.  Using the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} API [modify the permissons](/apidocs/cloudant#putsecurity){: new_window}{: external}.

No matter what method you choose,
remember to record the key name and password.
These values are both randomly generated,
and can't be retrieved if lost or forgotten.

[{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Data Layer Local Edition ("Cloudant Local")](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-local-overview) doesn't support API Keys. For a similar capability, create "CouchDB" style users, as described in the [Cloudant Local documentation](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-configure-ibm-cloudant-data-layer-local-edition#configuring-database-level-security).
{: note}

### Using API keys
{: #using-api-keys}

API keys are typically generated by using an account that has at least one database.
It's possible to use the API key with other databases,
or even with other accounts.

By default,
an API key has no permissions to anything.
It must be given permissions explicitly.

After you generate the API key,
grant the key access-specific permissions for a specific database by sending a `PUT` request to 
`https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_api/v2/db/$DATABASE/_security`.

The database doesn't have to be in the same account as the account used for generating the API key initially.

To give an existing API key permissions to access a database in another account,
do the following steps:

1.  Retrieve the existing [security permissions](/apidocs/cloudant#getsecurity){: new_window}{: external} for the database.
2.  [Add](/apidocs/cloudant#putsecurity){: new_window}{: external} the details of the API key to the database security permissions, along with the roles required.

For an example of this process,
see the blog article:
[Using an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} API key with multiple {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} databases and accounts](https://dx13.co.uk/articles/2016/04/11/using-a-cloudant-api-key-with-multiple-cloudant-databases-and-accounts/){: new_window}{: external}.

### Deleting API keys
{: #deleting-api-keys}

It's not possible to delete an API key.
An API key is always available for use if you know the key and its password.
However,
the API key is only useful when:

-   Assigned to a database.
-   Assigned permissions for working with the database.

To "delete" an API key,
remove it from the database.
All the permissions that were previously assigned to the API key for it to work with that database are then removed.

#### To remove an API key by using the Dashboard
{: #to-remove-an-api-key-by-using-the-dashboard}

1.	Click `Databases` > `Permissions`.
2.	Hover over the API key you would like to delete.
3.	Click the "`X`" that appears when you hover over the API key.

#### To remove an API key by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} API
{: #to-remove-an-api-key-by-using-the-cloudant-nosql-db-api}

Use the [modifying permissions](/apidocs/cloudant#putcloudantsecurity){: new_window}{: external} technique to remove the API key from the list of users with access permission.

This technique works because an API key is similar to a user,
and is granted access permissions.
By removing the API key from the list of users that have access permissions,
you remove the API key from the list of users that have access to the database.

To remove the API key,
send an HTTP `PUT` request to the same `_security` API endpoint you used to [create the API key](/apidocs/cloudant#putcloudantsecurity){: new_window}{: external} to remove the API key from the list of users with access permission. Provide an updated list of the usernames that have access permission.
The updated list must not include the API key.

## Using the `_users` database with {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}
{: #using-the-_users-database-with-cloudant-nosql-db}

This section pertains to Legacy credentials only. 
{: tip}

You can use the
[`_users` database](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/intro/security.html#authentication-database){: new_window}{: external}
to manage roles in {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

User documents that are stored in the `_users` database must be structured and populated to comply with
[Apache Software Foundation CouchDB requirements](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/intro/security.html?highlight=security#users-documents){: new_window}{: external}.

You can disable the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} authorization checks by setting the `couchdb_auth_only:true` parameter. 
To disable {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} security,
`PUT` a JSON document to the `_security` endpoint of the database.
For example, `https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_security`.

See the following example that uses HTTP to submit a modification request:

```http
PUT /$DATABASE/_security HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example that uses the command line to submit a modification request:

```sh
curl "https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_security" \
	-X PUT \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d @request-body.json
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example modification request in JSON format:

```json
{
	"couchdb_auth_only": true,
	"members": {
		"names": ["member"],"roles":[]
	},
	"admins": {
		"names": ["admin"],"roles":[]
	}
}
```
{: codeblock}

See the following example response from a modification request:

```json
{
	"ok" : true
}
```
{: codeblock}
