# Migrating to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #migrating-to-ibm-cloudant-on-ibm-cloud}

The [{{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant){: new_window}{: external} database-as-a-service offering is a JSON document store that runs on multi-tenant clusters. The service is available with a choice of geographical locations with predictable costs, scalability, and a service level agreement (SLA).
{: shortdesc}

This document describes how to migrate to an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Lite or Standard plan instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} from one of the following plans:

Plan | Description
-----|------------
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Enterprise | Dedicated, single-tenant clusters
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Shared Plan | A legacy pay-as-you-go, multi-tenant {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service. The `cloudant.com` Shared plan was retired on March 2018. The {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Shared plan was deprecated for new signups in October 2016 and is being retired in Q4 2018.
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_localfull}} | The self-hosted, packaged installation of {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.
Apache CouchDB | The self-hosted, open source database on which {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} is based.
{: caption="Table 1. {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} plans" caption-side="top"}

## What are the benefits of the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Lite and Standard plans?
{: #what-are-the-benefits-of-the-ibm-cloudant-lite-and-standard-plans-}

With the Standard plan, you can *reserve throughput capacity* for your database service, that is, to specify how much throughput your application's database is going to need to handle demand. The Standard plan also charges for the amount of storage you use. Capacity is measured by using the following metrics:

Metric | Description
-------|------------
Reads per second | The rate at which simple document fetches are performed, for example, retrieving a document by its `_id`, or queries against a partitioned database that uses a partition key.
Writes per second | The rate at which data is written to the database. API calls dealing with document creation, update, or deletion count as 'writes'.
Global Queries per second | The rate at which the database is queried by using global indexes, typically by accessing the `_find` endpoint or by using secondary MapReduce, search, or geospatial indices.
Storage | The amount of disk space occupied by your JSON data, attachments, and secondary indices.
{: caption="Table 2. Capacity metrics" caption-side="top"}

As an example, the Lite plan offers 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 1 GB of storage for free. This plan is ideal when you're `kicking the tires` of the product and during product development. When your application goes into QA or production, switch to the Standard plan to scale the instance. The Standard plan's smallest capacity has 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, 5 global queries per second, and 20 GB of storage for ~USD$76.65 per month. You can buy extra storage, which is charged by the GB.

By using the slider in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Dashboard, you can reserve a smaller or larger capacity for your {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service whenever you need it:

![Slider](../images/slider.png){: caption="Figure 1. Slider" caption-side="bottom"}

The amount that you can change the throughput capacity is limited to a maximum of 10 units per change with a maximum of one change per hour. Notice the "change limit" point on the slider. Changes downward are unlimited in size, but still subject to the time limit.
{: tip}

You're billed on the highest capacity that is selected in any given hourly window. Your database throughput can scale up to deal with seasonal demands and scale down again for the quiet times. Your monthly bill is always predictable; upgrades are automatic; and your SLA is [99.99%](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/sla/bm?OpenDocument){: new_window}{: external}.

If you exceed your quota of reads, writes, and global queries in a given second, the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} API responds with an `HTTP 429 too many requests` response. Your application might retry the request later - our official libraries offer the option of retrying such requests with an exponential back off. 

## Which type of {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} plan do I have?
{: #which-type-of-ibm-cloudant-plan-do-i-have-}

If you're using {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}, go to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard, and click the menu icon then **Resource List** to see all your service instances.  

![Cloud dashboard](../images/ibmclouddashboard.png){: caption="Figure 2. Cloud dashboard" caption-side="bottom"}

You can also drill down into a specific instance and look at the Plan tab for more information. {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instances on the deprecated Shared plan don't have a highlighted plan. An instance on the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Standard plan looks like this example: 

![Standard dashboard](../images/ibmcloud_instance_standard_plan.png){: caption="Figure 3. Standard dashboard" caption-side="bottom"}

You can also open the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Dashboard, and click the **Account** tab. A Lite plan looks like the following example:

![Lite plan](../images/migrate1.png){: caption="Figure 4. Lite plan" caption-side="bottom"}

If you're using a legacy `cloudant.com` account, you can log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Dashboard, and go to the Account tab. A legacy `cloudant.com` Shared plan has a Usage tab with graphs and billing estimates for the current month, like the following example:

![Shared plan](../images/cloudantcom_sharedplan_usage.png){: caption="Figure 5. Shared plan" caption-side="bottom"}

A `cloudant.com` Enterprise user on a dedicated cluster doesn't have the Usage tab in their Account tab. It looks like the following example:

![Enterprise plan](../images/cloudantcom_enterpriseplan_account.png){: caption="Figure 6. Enterprise plan" caption-side="bottom"}

If your Account tab already indicates that you're on the Standard plan, you don't need to read any further. You're already on a paid SLA-backed {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service. No further action is required.

## Migrating from {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Lite to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Standard

{: tip} 
 
Now, you're ready to go!

## Migrating everything else to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Lite or Standard plan
{: #migrating-everything-else-to-ibm-cloudant-lite-or-standard-plan}

Migration from the Shared or Enterprise plans to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Lite or Standard plans includes these tasks, which are described in the following steps. 

You can't directly change a Shared plan instance to a Lite or Standard plan instance. Migration requires that you create a new Lite or Standard plan instance and replicate the data over from the Shared plan instance. 
{: tip}

### Step 1. Sign up for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #step-1-sign-up-for-ibm-cloud}

[Sign up for an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/){: new_window}{: external}. 

### Step 2. Create an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instance
{: #step-2-create-an-ibm-cloudant-instance}

After you log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, add an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service. Click the `Create resource ` button on the dashboard and then click `Databases` and `Cloudant`. For more information, see [how to create an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-getting-started-with-cloudant).  

![Add {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instance.](../tutorials/images/img0003.png){: caption="Figure 8. Add {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instance" caption-side="bottom"}

### Step 3. Find out whether your application is ready for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}
{: #step-3-find-out-whether-your-application-is-ready-for-ibm-cloudant}

If you're moving from an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Enterprise service or an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Shared plan, you must revisit your applicationâ€™s usage of {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} to make sure it is ready to handle the capacity limits of the Standard plan. For more information, see [how the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} API works](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public#provisioned-throughput-capacity). Most importantly, you must make sure that your application can handle a `429: too many requests` HTTP response if you exceed your provisioned throughput capacity. 

Retrying requests that get a `429` response is acceptable for occasional traffic spikes that exceed your plan's capacity. If your application traffic is routinely generating `429` responses, you probably need to upgrade to a bigger plan.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the maximum individual document size is 1 MB on {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}, and you receive a `413: request entity too large` message if the limit is exceeded. For more information, see [request and document size limits](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public#request-and-document-size-limits). 

### Step 4. Migrate data from the old service to the new service 
{: #step-4-migrate-data-from-the-old-service-to-the-new-service}

Set up continuous replications from your existing service to your {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} account. For more information, see the [Replication guide](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-replication-api) and [Using {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics) about how to set up and monitor replication tasks.

Alternatively, check out the [`couchreplicate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/couchreplicate) tool, which is a command-line utility that helps you coordinate the transfer of data from one {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} account to another. It sets up multiple replication jobs between the source and target accounts, ensuring that only so many replication jobs proceed at one time. If you need to migrate hundreds of databases, then `couchreplicate` can help coordinate the replication jobs.

![Couch replication tool.](../images/couchreplicate.mp4){: caption="Figure 9. Couch replicate tool" caption-side="bottom"}

Verify that all your data replicates to the new service and that indexes are built.

### Step 5. Testing
{: #step-5-testing}

Conduct load and functional testing on your application to ensure that no issues exist before you migrate to production.

### Step 6. Ready to move to the new instance?
{: #step-6-ready-to-move-to-the-new-instance-}

When you're ready to move to the new instance, update your application to use  the new account URL and credentials for the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instance. For more information, see the [provisioning tutorial](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-getting-started-with-cloudant) about how to obtain the service credentials for an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instance.

### Step 7. Turn off the old service
{: #step-7-turn-off-the-old-service}

 When your application is fully migrated to the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Lite or Standard instance, you can delete the old {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Shared plan instance from your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. Deleting the instance ensures that you're no longer charged for the service.

## FAQ
{: #faq-migration}

FAQs are published by the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} organization to help {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} customers migrate to an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Lite or Standard plan instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

## Can I back up my data before I do anything?
{: #can-i-back-up-my-data-before-doing-anything-}

{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} recommends that you use the [couchbackup](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-backup-and-recovery#ibm-cloudant-backup-and-recovery) utility to export data to disk. [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage){: new_window}{: external} is an inexpensive, scalable solution for storing the exported files. 

## Can I keep my `username.cloudant.com` domain and redirect it to the new service on {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}?
{: #can-i-keep-my-username-cloudant-com-domain-and-redirect-it-to-the-new-service-on-ibm-cloudant-}

No, it's not possible to keep your domain. You must plan to update your applications to use the new account URL and credentials that are generated for the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} instances.

## Who do I contact if I have questions?
{: #who-do-i-contact-if-i-have-questions-}
