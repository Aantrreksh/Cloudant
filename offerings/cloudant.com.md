Cloudant is a hosted and fully-managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS).
It is built from the ground up to scale globally,
run non-stop,
and handle a wide variety of data types like [JSON](../basics/index.html#json),
[full-text](../api/cloudant_query.html#creating-an-index),
and [geospatial](../api/cloudant-geo.html).

Cloudant is an operational data store optimized to handle concurrent reads and writes,
and enables high availability and data durability.

It provides an [HTTP API](../basics/index.html#http-api) for working with your [JSON](../basics/index.html#json) data,
and 24-hour operational support and maintenance.
Cloudant is based on [Apache CouchDB ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://couchdb.apache.org/){:new_window},
and is delivered as various multi-tenant,
dedicated,
and installed services.
