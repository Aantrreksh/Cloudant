Users of {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} can use {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} to access audit logs for the service. {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. You can also be alerted about actions as they happen.
