To help troubleshooting begin as quickly as possible, you must include the output of the Weatherreport utility, as well as, any relevant logs, requests, and status codes when informing support of an issue. For more information, see the [Weatherreport utility ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTPQH_1.1.0/com.ibm.cloudant.local.install.doc/topics/clinstall_checking_health_cluster_with_weatherreport.html){: new_window}.
