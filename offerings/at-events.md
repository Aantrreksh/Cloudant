# Activity Tracker events
{: #at_events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact with the {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. You can also be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [Getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-getting-started#getting-started){: new_window}{: external}.

## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events are available in the Dallas, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Sydney, and London locations. 

Events that are generated by an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location. 

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web user interface of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} UI](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-launch#launch_step2){: new_window}{: external}.
