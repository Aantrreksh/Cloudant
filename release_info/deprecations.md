# Deprecations
{: #deprecations}

Summary of the changes in behavior for {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} releases. 
{: shortdesc}

## Replaced deprecated database information fields
{: #replaced-dbinfo-size-fields}

Calls to `GET /{db}` were replaced by the following fields:

| Old Field | New Field |
|-----------|-----------|
| `data_size` | `sizes.active` |
| `disk_size` | `sizes.file` |
| `other.data_size` | `sizes.external` |
{: caption="Table 1. Database information fields" caption-side="top"}

Calls to `GET /{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_info` were replaced by the following fields:

| Old Field | New Field|
|-----------|----------|
| `data_size` | `sizes.external` |
| `disk_size` | `sizes.file` | 
{: caption="Table 1. Design doc information fields" caption-side="top"}

## Replaced `queries` parameter
{: #replaced-queries-parameter}

The `queries` parameter for performing multiple view queries in a single request is no longer accepted as a URL parameter for `GET /{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_view/{view}` or a request body parameter for `POST /{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_view/{view}`. The parameter was replaced with the endpoint `POST /{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_view/{view}/queries` and is supplied as a `queries` request body parameter.

You can also make multiple queries with the following new endpoints: 

- `POST /{db}/_all_docs/queries`
- `POST /{db}/_design_docs/queries`

## Multiple restrictions employed for performance gains (21 October 2019)

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} is releasing exciting new capabilities for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} that will be available in the near future. Before that happens, {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} is documenting the deprecation of some functionality, and also, new, yet to be enforced, restrictions for other processes. A communication will be released that details the exact timeline when these restrictions go into effect. If you use any of the following functionality or are concerned about how to make the necessary application changes, reach out to support by email.  

The following functions are affected by this deprecation: 

1. Remove the `offset` field from the response body of an `all_docs` request. The {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} team recommends that you use paging with `start_key` / `end_key` and `limit`.
2. The `_sorted` field has no functional effect because all responses are sorted automatically. 
3. Duration of operations has a 5-second limit. Transactions lasting more than 5 seconds fail. 
4. Limitations on keys (10KB) and values (100KB) that are emitted from a map function are shown in the following list: 
- The sum of all keys emitted for a document cannot exceed 100 KB.
- Emitted keys cannot exceed 10 KB.
- Values cannot exceed 100 KB.
- In rare cases, the number of key-value pairs emitted for a map function might lead to a transaction either exceeding 10 MB in size, which isnâ€™t allowed, or exceeding 5 MB, which impacts the performance of the database. In this situation, {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} returns an error.
5. The `stable = true` option is no longer supported, and the `stale = "ok"` option is converted to `update = false`.


## {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} feature is deprecated (7 February 2018)
{: #cloudant-nosql-db-feature-is-deprecated-february-7-2018}

To find alternatives to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}'s {{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}} feature, see the 
[data-flow-examples repository](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/data-flow-examples){: new_window}{: external} for tutorials on 
extracting {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} documents and writing the data to a 
{{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} table.

### Extracting {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} login information for stopped warehouse jobs
{: #extracting-db2-warehouse-on-cloud-login-information-for-stopped-warehouse-jobs}

Before you can sign in to the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} console, you need the URL and credentials. This information is located in the `warehouser` document. 

To retrieve information from the `warehouser` document, you must run the following curl command:

```sh
curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD "https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_warehouser/$DOCUMENT_ID"
```
{: codeblock}

Before you run the command, replace `$DOCUMENT_ID` with `example@source-db`. In this case, `example` is the `warehouser` document's name. `source-db` is the source database's name that is used for replicating {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} to DB2.

```sh
curl -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD "https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/_warehouser/example@source-db"
```
{: codeblock}

*Example response when you search for information in the `warehouser` document:*

```http
{
  "_id": "example@source-db",
  "dashboard_url": "https://dashdb-entry-yp-lon02-01.services.eu-gb.bluemix.net/login",
  "dynamite_token": "XXXXXXXX",
  "target": "jdbc:db2://dashdb-entry-yp-lon02-01.services.eu-gb.bluemix.net:50000/BLUDB",
  "dynamite_user": "dash12345",
  ...
}
```
{: codeblock}

The information that is returned in the previous example is described in the following list:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `_id` | ID of the `_warehouser` document |
| `dashboard_url` | URL of the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} console |
| `dynamite_token` | DB2 password |
| `target` | DB2 JDBC connection URL, only used if the value for `dashboard_url` is null. |
| `dynamite_user` | DB2 user name |
{: caption="Table 3. Fields from the previous example response" caption-side="top"}

To sign in to the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} console, you need to remember the values for each of the following fields that are taken from the previous response example: `dynamite_user`, `dynamite_token`, and `dashboard_url`.
       
1. From a browser, go to the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} console by using the value in the `dashboard_url` field.  

  To sign in to the {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort_notm}} console, use the value from the `dashboard_url` field. If the value for the `dashboard_url` field is `null`, you can use the host value from the `target` field to create the URL for signing in to the console. For example, the host value for the `target` field from the previous example output is `dashdb-entry-yp-lon02-01.services.eu-gb.bluemix.net`. If you add the protocol `https` and the Postfix `login`, you can sign in with the following URL, `https://dashdb-entry-yp-lon02-01.services.eu-gb.bluemix.net/login`.
  {: note}

2. To sign in, use the value of the `dynamite_user` field as your user name and the `dynamite_token` field as your password.

## Disabled JavaScript constructors (7 December 2017)
{: #disabled-javascript-constructors-december-7-2017}

- If a user calls the disabled JavaScript constructors, `eval()` or `Function()`, an error message
similar to this one is returned, "Call to `eval()` was blocked by CSP." You can fix the problem 
by replacing `eval()` calls with the calls from the 
[expr-eval library](https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval){: new_window}{: external}.

## Removed support for virtual hosts (4 December 2017)
{: #disabled-vhosts-december-4-2017}

- On 4 December 2017, {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} disabled the virtual host functionality. Support for insecure HTTP connections was replaced by HTTPS only. After you turn off HTTP support, the virtual hosts feature is no longer available since use of virtual hosts precludes secure HTTPS connections. Previous users of the virtual host feature need to make alternative arrangements to present a chosen host name to your clients from your application and use HTTPS connections only.

## Error handling
{: #error-handling}

- If you rely on 500 replies for your application, you might have issues. To fix the problem, 
update your application to rely on 400 responses. 

- If you don't take care of reduce overflow errors as part of a row in the response body, 
issues occur. To fix this problem, change the application to handle the errors 
from view requests.  

## Incompatibility between CouchDB version 1.6 and {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} version 2.0.0
{: #incompatibility-between-couchdb-version-1-6-and-ibm-cloudant-version-2-0-0}

- An incompatibility exists between the most recent version of {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} and CouchDB 1.6-based codebase. In the older version of {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}, if you add a query parameter ("reduce=false") to the request body, the parameter 
in the request body is ignored. However, the parameter in the request URL is respected. In recent versions of 
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}, the query parameter ("reduce=false") in the request body isn't ignored.

## Revised error message
{: #revised-error-message}

- The error message that occurs when you try to put a document attachment with a non-existent revision that is changed to a 409 error with the following information:

	```
	{"error":"not_found","reason":"missing_rev"}
	```
  {: codeblock}

## X-Frame-Options setting (17 August 2017)
{: #x-frame-options-setting}

The `X-Frame-Options` setting is a response header that controls whether an HTTP response can be embedded in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, or `<object>`. This security feature helps prevent click jacking.

You can configure this option based on your CORS settings. If CORS is enabled, `X-Frame-Options` are automatically enabled and send the response header, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, by default. If a request HOST header matches the URL listed in the origins section of CORS, an `X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM URL` response header is returned.
 
This change might impact customers who are accessing the database directly from the browser. If you see the error message, "X-Frame-Options: DENY", 
and it's breaking your service, you must enable CORS by [modifying the CORS configuration](/apidocs/cloudant#putcorsconfiguration){: new_window}{: external}. After you enable CORS, add the value of the HOST header that you send in the request 
to the list of allowed `origins`.

## `dbcopy` (4 February 2016)
{: #-dbcopy-february-4-2016-}

- The `dbcopy` feature can cause problems under some circumstances.
  Information about the feature was removed from the documentation.
  Use of `dbcopy` is discouraged.
