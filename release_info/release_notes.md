versions (TLS 1.0 and 1.1) at which point only TLS 1.2+ will be supported.***)

Find more information on our [Security page](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-security#security).

## Build 7205 (September 07, 2018)
{: #build-7205-september-07-2018}

- Refactor Mango Query selectors to reduce the amount of traffic sent between nodes in the cluster.
- Expose document update errors on concurrent document updates to client.
- Fix `render_error` errors where the `req` object that is passed to the JavaScript list function is set to `noproc` atom.

## Build 7138 (August 17, 2018)
{: #build-7138-august-17-2018}

- Upgrade to Erlang/OTP 20.

- While compaction is running, delete compaction files when database is deleted.
- Improve sandboxing features.
- Optimize authentication check.
- Change semantics of status codes for delete database.
- Support `conflicts: true` for queries to the `/{db}/_find` endpoint.
- Preserve `update_seq` field across view compaction.


## Build 7084 (July 12, 2018)
{: #build-7084-july-12-2018}

- Refactor code for `_stats` reducer.
- Fix active size calculations for views.
- Rewrite the `couch_key_tree` algorithm to reduce its computational complexity and avoid calling stemming when unnecessary.
- Change allocation strategy for message queue for each important process so it is not stored on the heap of that process.
- Improvements to internal audit facility.
- Any constant fields that are in the selector, and are part of the index, for example, {A: {$eq: 10}}, are inserted into the sort list if they are not already included. This method increases the chance that the best index is selected for the query, for example, index = [A, B], sort = [B], and selector = {A: 1}. The sort then becomes [A, B].

<p class="tip">Only the fields that are in front of the current sort fields in the list are added.</p>

- Introduce new action, `DELETE`, on the `/_iam_session` endpoint, which invalidates the IAM session cookie.

## Build 6909 (April 26, 2018)
{: #build-6909-april-26-2018}

- Improve compatibility with IAM.

- Prevent `chttpd` multipart zombie processes.
- Avoid unconditional retries in replicator's HTTP client.
- Update MochiWeb to version 2.17.
- Introduce new `_dbs_info` endpoint to get information from a list of databases. See

- Change semantics of status codes for create database.

## Build 6620 (January 10, 2018)
{: #build-6620-january-10-2018}

- Query: fallback to `selector` on an empty `partial_filter_selector` field.

## Build 6600 (December 28, 2017)
{: #build-6600-december-28-2017}

- Query: fields that are referenced within `$or` operations are considered when {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} query determines the usable
indexes for a particular selector.

## Build 6588 (December 7, 2017)
{: #build-6588-december-7-2017}

- A new parameter, `create_target_params`, was added for you to customize the target database
that is created on a new replication. You can now customize the cluster's default values for the number of shards and
replicas to create.
- A request to `/_scheduler` without specifying subsections `docs` or `jobs` now returns a `Not found` error.
- A new error is returned when a `new_edits` value is invalid in the `/db/_bulk_docs` URL. The error is `400: Bad request.`
- For security reasons, by default, the use of `eval()` and `Function()` constructors is disabled in
JavaScript.
- Added the header `Prefer: return=minimal` to return only essential headers. This header reduces the size of the request, which gives a performance improvement to non-browser clients.

### Query (<code>_find</code> endpoint):
{: #query-code-_find-code-endpoint}

- {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query now uses a new method to select an index. Learn more about [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query index selection ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22011923){: new_window}.
- The logic for determining whether a specific index is valid for a query changed, addressing a bug that might lead to incorrect results.
- Queries that use text indexes no longer fail when `$exists`: `false` is used.
- Partial indexes are now supported for both JSON and text indexes. For more information, see  [Creating a partial index](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-query#creating-a-partial-index) for more information.
- Execution statistics about a query can now be generated. These statistics are enabled by using the `execution_stats=true` parameter. For more information, see [finding documents by using an index](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-query#finding-documents-by-using-an-index) for more information.
- [Pagination](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-query#pagination) is supported by using the bookmark field. Bookmarks are enabled for all index types.
- `_find` now falls back to any valid index if the value specified in the `use_index`
field is invalid for the current query. When this occurs, the `warning` field is populated in the query response.

## Build 6365 (August 17, 2017)
{: #build-6365-august-17-2017}

- `POST` requests to the `_revs_diff` endpoint require either the `_reader` or `_replicator` role.
- Add the `X-Frame-Options` header settings to prevent click jacking. Learn more about [X-Frame-Options setting](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-deprecations#x-frame-options-setting).
- Add the replication scheduler. Learn more about [replication scheduler](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-advanced-replication#the-replication-scheduler).

## Build 6276 (July 4, 2017)
{: #build-6276-july-4-2017}

- An error message changed that occurs when you attempt to put a document attachment with a non-existent revision.
Now, the error is a 409 error with the following information: `{`error`:`not_found`,`reason`:`missing_rev`}`.

## Build 6233 (June 26, 2017)
{: #build-6233-june-26-2017}

- Fixes an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query issue where indexes that excluded potentially matching documents were selected by the query planner.

## Build 6069 (May 11, 2017)
{: #build-6069-may-11-2017}

- Previously, a replication job that failed for some reason, which resulted in an update to the replication document,
  was followed by a fresh attempt to start a new replication.
  Under some circumstances,
  this behavior might continue indefinitely: many duplicates of the same error message.
  A fix was introduced so that the replication document is not updated unless the reason for the error changes.
- If the design document that is intended to specify a geospatial index is invalid,
  an attempt to retrieve information about the index by using
  the [`_geo_info` endpoint](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-cloudant-nosql-db-geospatial#cloudant-nosql-db-geospatial)
  results in an [HTTP `404`](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-http#http-status-codes) response.
- Added support for the `$allmatch` operator.

## Build 5834 (February 13, 2017)

{: #build-5278-november-25-2016}

- {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} is more tolerant of malformed user documents that are stored within the `_users` database.
  User documents must be structured and populated to comply with
  [Apache Software Foundation CouchDB requirements ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/intro/security.html#users-documents){: new_window}.

## Build 5638 (October 11, 2016)
{: #build-5638-october-11-2016}

-   Introduces new `stable` and `update` query parameters for views.
-   Replicator no longer retries forever if it cannot write checkpoints to the source database.

## Build 5421 (June 14, 2016)
{: #build-5421-june-14-2016}

-	Changes feeds support view-based filters.
-	Changes feeds support the `_doc_ids` filter.
-	`POST` requests are supported for `_changes`.
-	Both `_all_docs` and `_changes` support the `attachments=true` parameter.
-	Support for the CouchDB 1.6 `_users` database features, including server-side hashing of passwords when documents are created in the `_users` database.
-	`/_bulk_get` endpoint to reduce the number of requests that are used in replication to mobile clients.
-	Design document metadata contains an `update pending` field.
-	{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query no longer returns an error if no valid index exists.
