# Release notes
{: #release-notes}

Changes and updates to {{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}} that are grouped by build number.
{: shortdesc}

## New features
{: #new-features}

### Partition Query (February 2019)
{: #partition-query-february-2019}

The new Partition Query feature provides a new way to structure
data in {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}, which offers both cost savings and performance gains for your
applications.

For more information, see the following link:

- Read the [guide to partition query](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning).

### Dedicated Hardware (June 2017)
{: #dedicated-hardware}

A new Dedicated Hardware plan is available.

For more information, see the following links:

- Read about the [Dedicated Hardware plan](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-public#dedicated-hardware-plan){: new_window}{: external}.

### Replication scheduler
{: #replication-scheduler}

The new replication scheduler has several improvements and enhancements. Learn more about the replication scheduler.

## Build 8169 (December 2020)
{: #build-8169-12-2020}

- Bug fixes.
- Report the database that was used for authentication for a `GET /_session` request, provided it is configured.
- Introduce the Mango query operator, `$keyMapMatch`, that allows you to make queries on the keys of a map.

## Build 8162 (September 2020)
{: #build-8162-09-2020}

- Bug fixes.
- `Drilldown` parameters for text index searches can now be specified as a list of lists, which allows you to avoid having to define this redundantly in a single query. (Some languages don't have this facility.)
- The `couch_index` server doesn't crash and log errors in the following cases: If a design document is deleted while that index is building, or when a design document is added immediately after database creation.
- {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} now checks for and reports invalid parameters on database creation.

## Build 8158 (July 2020)
{: #build-8158-07-2020}

- Bug fixes.

## Build 8153 (May 2020)
{: #build-8153-05-2020}

- Bug fixes.

## Build 8152 (April 2020)
{: #build-8152-04-2020}

- Bug fixes.

## Build 8142 (March 2020)
{: #build-8142-03-2020}

- New endpoints were added so you can post multiple queries: `POST /{db}/_all_docs/queries` and `POST /{db}/_design_docs/queries`.
- The `disk_size` and `data_size` fields were retired from the database info object returned by `GET /{db}`. 
- The ability to submit multiple queries against a view by using the `POST` to `/{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_view/{view}` with the `?queries` option was replaced by the new `queries` endpoint. The same is true of the `_all_docs` and `_design_docs`endpoints. Specify a `keys` object when `POST`ing to these endpoints. 
- The `/{db}/_changes` feed immediately returns headers now, even when no changes are available. This process prevents client blocking.
- Negative and non-integer heartbeat values now return a `400 Bad Request` response status code.
- Allow specifying separate proxies for both the source and target in a replication via `source_proxy` and `target_proxy` keys.  
- The `POST` view functionality now supports identical parameters and behavior as specified in the `/{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_view/{view}`, `/{db}/_all_docs`, and `/{db}/_design_docs` endpoints. You can supply query string parameters as keys in a JSON object in the body of the `POST` request.
- Replication `"info"` errors are now JSON objects. Previously, they were strings. 
- A compatibility change was made to support replication with future databases that contain per-document access control fields.
- Add a warning to the `_find` endpoint if multiple document scans were required to generate a result.
- Fix a bug in the `_find` endpoint whereby an error would be returned if a document matched by a text index was deleted while the query was being processed.  


## Build 8126 (January 2020)
{: #build-8126-January-2020}

- Bug fixes.
- Improvements to replication error reporting - instead of a function_clause, human-readable markers are returned, for example, `bulk_docs_failed`. Stack traces are no longer included.
- Replication job statistics, such as `docs_read`, `docs_written`, and `doc_write_failures` are preserved when replication jobs restart.
- Replication jobs to a target endpoint by using IAM Writer permissions no longer crash and continuously restart when they write design documents. Instead, the `doc_write_failures` statistic is incremented for each failed design document write. This behavior is consistent with replicating by using the legacy API-key-based authentication.

## Build 8111 (November 2019)
{: #build-8111-november-2019}

- Bug fixes.
- The `_scheduler/docs` endpoint now includes more detailed replication statistics to match `_active_tasks` output. It also includes details on replications that started with `_replicate`.
- Fix an instance where the replicator failed a replication but the error was recoverable.
- Fix a bug introduced in recent builds where sending an empty payload to `_bulk_docs` would result in a 400 response status code rather than accepting the no-op operation.

## Build 8106 (October 2019)
{: #build-8106-october-2019}

- Bug fixes.

## Build 8103 (October 2019)
{: #build-8103-october-2019}

- New `X-Cloudant-Action` HTTP response header that returns the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}    IAM actions that are associated with a request.
- Previously, search requests would return a `400` status code both on a bad
    request and on internal server errors. Now, internal server errors correctly
    return a `500` response status code.

## Build 8076 (June 2019)
{: #build-8076-june-2019}

- Bug fixes.
- Stability improvements.

## Build 8070 (May 2019)
{: #build-8070-may-2019}

- Bug fixes.

## Build 8062 (May 2019)
{: #build-8062-may-2019}

- Bug fixes.

## Build 8058 (April 2019)
{: #build-8058-april-2019}

- Fixed bug in `ibrowse` HTTP client that leaves dead process IDs in the connection pool, and in some cases, caused persistent IAM-based replication failures.

## Build 8052 (April 2019)
{: #build-8052-april-2019}

- Accessing the database information endpoint (`/db/`) for a partitioned database
    now includes information about the contained partitioned indexes. The new field, `partitioned_indexes`, contains the following
    information:

    - The current number of partitioned indexes in the database (`count`).
    - A breakdown of those indexes by type (`indexes`).
    - The maximum partitioned indexes allowed for this database (`limit`).

## Build 8048 (March 2019)
{: #build-8048-march-2019}
- No user visible changes; bug fixes.

## Build 8038 (March 2019)
{: #build-8038-march-2019}
- Allow `POST` when you search [partition queries](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning#database-partitioning).

## Build 7681 (February 2019)
{: #build-7681-february-2019}

- Partition query bug fixes.

## Build 7668 (January 2019)
{: #build-7668-january-2019}

- This build introduces a new feature, [Partition Query](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning#database-partitioning).
- Allow `limit` when you use `POST` for search.
- Previously, view requests that use a `limit` parameter greater than 268435456 would have the limit silently reduced to 268435456. Now, requests with the `limit` parameter greater than 268435456 are rejected with a `400 Bad Request` error.

## Build 7631Â (January 2019)
{: #build-7631-january 2019}

-   Internal changes and bug fixes.

## Build 7544 (December 2018)
{: #build-7544-december-2018}

- Fixed a problem where the replicator would sometimes reset statistics during
    replications. The reset would affect values in the [replication status
    information](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-advanced-replication#advanced-replication).
     See [PR](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1722){: new_window}{: external}.
- Fixed an issue with {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query. After deleting a document, if you issue
    a `_find` request to a text index with `update=false`, it might return a
    `500` response.
    See [PR](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1709){: new_window}{: external}.
- You can now use `multipart/mixed` and `multipart/related` when you use
    `_bulk_get`. See [PR](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1195){: new_window}{: external}.
- Fix a bug with total row count in the `_design_docs` handler.
     See [PR](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1744){: new_window}{: external}.
- Optimizations to the `_doc_id` and `_design_docs` replication filters.
     See [issue](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1737){: new_window}{: external}.
- Fix a regression where long-running index jobs can fail.

## Build 7426 (15 November 2018)
{: #build-7426-november-15-2018}

- Include [CRN](/docs/account?topic=account-crn) in audit logs.
- Replicator stability improvements.
- Improve validation of `q` parameter on database creation. See [COUCHDB-1582](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1582){: new_window}{: external}.
- Fix error in `_bulk_get` endpoint for the `_users` database. See [COUCHDB-1650](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1650){: new_window}{: external}.
- Fix JavaScript URL rewrites hanging on `POST` or `PUT` requests. See [COUCHDB-1612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1612){: new_window}{: external}.
- Fix invalid `reduce` functions in {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query indexes that prevent indexing. See [COUCHDB-1666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1666){: new_window}{: external}.
- Internal bug fixes to data compression, search, and core database components.

## Build 7410 (4 November 18)
{: #build-7410-november-04-2018}

- Internal changes and bug fixes.

## Build 7304 (11 October 2018)
{: #build-7304-october-11-2018}

- This build is identical to build 7302 except that it's built on Erlang 17.5 instead of Erlang 20.

## Build 7302 (25 September 2018)
{: #build-7302-september-25-2018}

- Improve Mango Query so that mixed clusters return correct results during upgrades.
- Add a downgrade function to support future cluster purge releases.
- Improve search blocklist.

## Build 7276 (18 September 2018)
{: #build-7276-september-18-2018}

- Add a filter for databases that are being opened asynchronously to prevent exceptions when `couch_server` terminates.
- Fix `couch_server` concurrency error.
- Add a configuration option to disable off-heap messages.

## TLS 1.3 Supported (13 September 2018)
{: #tls-1-3-supported-september-13-2018}

From today, we support TLS 1.3 connections to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

We recommend you use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 for all access to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.
***(In June 2019, {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} is retiring the use of older
versions (TLS 1.0 and 1.1) at which point only TLS 1.2+ will be supported.)***

Find more information on our [Security page](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-security#security).

## Build 7205 (07 September 2018)
{: #build-7205-september-07-2018}

- Refactor Mango Query selectors to reduce the amount of traffic sent between nodes in the cluster.
- Expose document update errors on concurrent document updates to client.
- Fix `render_error` errors where the `req` object that is passed to the JavaScript list function is set to `noproc` atom.

## Build 7138 (17 August 2018)
{: #build-7138-august-17-2018}

- Upgrade to Erlang/OTP 20.

## Build 7137 (15 August 2018)
{: #build-7137-august-15-2018}

- Improve validation of configuration parameters supplied by administrator.
- While compaction is running, delete compaction files when database is deleted.
- Improve sandboxing features.
- Optimize authentication check.
- Change semantics of status codes for delete database.
- Support `conflicts: true` for queries to the `/{db}/_find` endpoint.
- Preserve `update_seq` field across view compaction.


## Build 7084 (12 July 2018)
{: #build-7084-july-12-2018}

- Refactor code for `_stats` reducer.
- Fix active size calculations for views.
- Rewrite the `couch_key_tree` algorithm to reduce its computational complexity and avoid calling stemming when unnecessary.
- Change allocation strategy for message queue for each important process, so it's not stored on the heap of that process.
- Improvements to internal audit facility.
- Any constant fields that are in the selector, and are part of the index, for example, {A: {$eq: 10}}, are inserted into the sort list if they aren't already included. This method increases the chance that the best index is selected for the query, for example, index = [A, B], sort = [B], and selector = {A: 1}. The sort then becomes [A, B].

Only the fields that are in front of the current sort fields in the list are added.
{: tip}

[Get a list of all databases in the account](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databases#get-a-list-of-all-databases-in-the-account).
- Prepare for session support in replicator.

## Build 6656 (15 February 2018)
{: #build-6656-february-15-2018}

- Update `_design_docs` to respect the query parameters that are used by `_all_docs`. See [Get design documents](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databases#get-documents).
- When you send a `COPY` request to `/$DATABASE/docid` endpoint, {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} now decodes the Destination header and creates a new ID without escaped values.

- Change semantics of status codes for create database.

## Build 6620 (10 January 2018)
{: #build-6620-january-10-2018}

- Query falls back to `selector` on an empty `partial_filter_selector` field.

## Build 6600 (28 December 2017)
{: #build-6600-december-28-2017}

- Query fields that are referenced within `$or` operations are considered when {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} query determines the usable
indexes for a particular selector.

## Build 6588 (7 December 2017)
{: #build-6588-december-7-2017}

- A new parameter, `create_target_params`, was added for you to customize the target database
that is created on a new replication. You can now customize the cluster's default values for the number of shards and
replicas to create.
- A request to `/_scheduler` without specifying subsections `docs` or `jobs` now returns a `Not found` error.
- A new error is returned when a `new_edits` value is invalid in the `/db/_bulk_docs` URL. The error is `400: Bad request`.
- For security reasons, by default, the use of `eval()` and `Function()` constructors is disabled in
JavaScript.
- Added the header `Prefer: return=minimal` to return only essential headers. This header reduces the size of the request, which gives a performance improvement to non-browser clients.

### Query (`_find` endpoint)
{: #query-code-_find-code-endpoint}

- {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query now uses a new method to select an index. Learn more about [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query index selection](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22011923){: new_window}{: external}.
- The logic for determining whether a specific index is valid for a query that changed, addressing a bug that might lead to incorrect results.
- Queries that use text indexes no longer fail when `$exists`: `false` is used.
- Partial indexes are now supported for both JSON and text indexes. For more information, see  [Creating a partial index](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query#creating-a-partial-index) for more information.
- Execution statistics about a query can now be generated. These statistics are enabled by using the `execution_stats=true` parameter. For more information, see [finding documents by using an index](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query#finding-documents-by-using-an-index) for more information.
- [Pagination](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query#pagination_query) is supported by using the bookmark field. Bookmarks are enabled for all index types.
- `_find` now falls back to any valid index if the value specified in the `use_index`
field is invalid for the current query. When `find` falls back, the `warning` field is populated in the query response.

## Build 6365 (17 August 2017)
{: #build-6365-august-17-2017}

- `POST` requests to the `_revs_diff` endpoint require either the `_reader` or `_replicator` role.
- Add the `X-Frame-Options` header settings to prevent click jacking. Learn more about [X-Frame-Options setting](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-deprecations#x-frame-options-setting).
- Add the replication scheduler. Learn more about [replication scheduler](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-advanced-replication#the-replication-scheduler).

## Build 6276 (4 July 2017)
{: #build-6276-july-4-2017}

- An error message changed that occurs when you try to put a document attachment with a non-existent revision.
Now, the error is a 409 error with the following information: `{`error`:`not_found`,`reason`:`missing_rev`}`.

## Build 6233 (26 June 2017)
{: #build-6233-june-26-2017}

- Fixes an {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query issue where indexes that excluded potentially matching documents were selected by the query planner.

## Build 6069 (11 May 2017)
{: #build-6069-may-11-2017}

- Previously, a replication job that failed for some reason, which resulted in an update to the replication document,
  was followed by a fresh attempt to start a new replication.
  Under some circumstances,
  this behavior might continue indefinitely: many duplicates of the same error message.
  A fix was introduced so that the replication document is not updated unless the reason for the error changes.
- If the design document that is intended to specify a geospatial index is invalid,
  an attempt to retrieve information about the index by using
  the [`_geo_info` endpoint](/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cloudant-nosql-db-geospatial#cloudant-nosql-db-geospatial)
  results in an [HTTP `404`](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant#list-of-http-codes) response.
- Added support for the `$allmatch` operator.

## Build 5834 (13 February 2017)
{: #build-5834-february-13-2017}

- The maximum length of a document `id` is now 7168 characters (7k).

## Build 5728 (25 November 2016)
{: #build-5278-november-25-2016}

- {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} is more tolerant of malformed user documents that are stored within the `_users` database.
  User documents must be structured and populated to comply with
  [Apache Software Foundation CouchDB requirements](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/intro/security.html?highlight=security#users-documents){: new_window}{: external}.

## Build 5638 (11 October 2016)
{: #build-5638-october-11-2016}

-   Introduces new `stable` and `update` query parameters for views.
-   Replicator no longer retries forever if it cannot write checkpoints to the source database.

## Build 5421 (14 June 2016)
{: #build-5421-june-14-2016}

-	Changes feeds support view-based filters.
-	Changes feeds support the `_doc_ids` filter.
-	`POST` requests are supported for `_changes`.
-	Both `_all_docs` and `_changes` support the `attachments=true` parameter.
-	Support for the CouchDB 1.6 `_users` database features, including server-side hashing of passwords when documents are created in the `_users` database.
-	`/_bulk_get` endpoint to reduce the number of requests that are used in replication to mobile clients.
-	Design document metadata contains an `update pending` field.
-	{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} Query no longer returns an error if no valid index exists.
